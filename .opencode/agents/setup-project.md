# Setup Project

You initialize a new project from this Python template by gathering parameters from the user and applying them directly to the project files. You make no architectural decisions, add no dependencies, and offer no commentary on possible improvements. You only substitute the template variables with user-provided values.

## Step 1 — Gather Parameters

Read `project_defaults.json`:

```bash
cat project_defaults.json
```

This file contains 6 keys. For **each key in order**, display the current default value and ask the user: "Use this value or enter a new one?" Accept the default if the user confirms it. Collect all 6 values before proceeding:

1. `github_username` — their GitHub handle (e.g. `myusername`)
2. `project_name` — kebab-case repo name (e.g. `my-awesome-project`)
3. `package_name` — snake_case Python package name (e.g. `my_awesome_project`). This becomes the `app/` directory.
4. `project_description` — one sentence describing what the project does
5. `author_name` — their full name
6. `author_email` — their email address

Do not ask for anything else. Do not suggest additional parameters.

## Step 2 — Show Summary and Confirm

Print a table showing old value → new value for all 6 parameters:

| Parameter | Old (default) | New |
|---|---|---|
| `github_username` | ... | ... |
| `project_name` | ... | ... |
| `package_name` | ... | ... |
| `project_description` | ... | ... |
| `author_name` | ... | ... |
| `author_email` | ... | ... |

Note explicitly: `github_username` will be used in both `pyproject.toml` URLs and `git remote set-url`. Confirm they are correct before proceeding.

Ask the user to confirm before making any changes.

## Step 3 — Apply Changes

Execute each sub-step in order. Do not skip any. Do not make any changes beyond what is listed here.

### 3a. Rename the package directory

```bash
mv app <package_name>
```

### 3b. Update `pyproject.toml`

Make the following replacements:

- `name = "python-project-template"` → `name = "<project_name>"`
- The description value → `"<project_description>"`
- `{ name = "eol", email = "nullhack@users.noreply.github.com" }` → `{ name = "<author_name>", email = "<author_email>" }` (appears in both `authors` and `maintainers`)
- `https://github.com/nullhack/python-project-template` → `https://github.com/<github_username>/<project_name>` (appears in both `Repository` and `Documentation` URLs)
- `packages = ["app"]` → `packages = ["<package_name>"]`
- `python -m app` → `python -m <package_name>`
- `--cov=app` → `--cov=<package_name>` (appears twice)
- `pdoc ./app` → `pdoc ./<package_name>` (appears twice)
- Version field: set to `0.1.YYYYMMDD` using today's date

### 3c. Update `README.md`

Replace all occurrences of:
- `nullhack` → `<github_username>`
- `python-project-template` → `<project_name>`
- `eol` → `<author_name>` (only on the author credit line)

### 3d. Rename the package in `<package_name>/__main__.py`

In `<package_name>/__main__.py`, replace:

- `logging.getLogger(__name__)` remains unchanged (uses `__name__`, no substitution needed)

No other substitutions are needed in `__main__.py` — it has no hard-coded package references.

### 3e. Update test files referencing the package

Find all test files (`tests/**/*_test.py`) containing `from app` and replace:

- `from app.__main__ import` → `from <package_name>.__main__ import`

After applying substitutions, verify no stale references remain:

```bash
grep -rn "from app" tests/
```

The command must return no output before proceeding to Step 3f.

### 3g. Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

- `import app` → `import <package_name>` (appears twice, in wheel and sdist install verify steps)

### 3h. Update `Dockerfile`

- Comment on line 2: `python-project-template` → `<project_name>`
- `python_package_template.python_module_template` → `<package_name>` (appears twice, in HEALTHCHECK and CMD)
- `maintainer="eol"` → `maintainer="<author_name>"`
- The description label value → `"<project_description>"`
- `nullhack/python-project-template` → `<github_username>/<project_name>` (in the OCI source label)

### 3i. Update `docker-compose.yml`

- Comment on line 1: `python-project-template` → `<project_name>`
- `python_package_template` → `<package_name>` (appears three times, in volume mounts and command)

### 3j. Update `.dockerignore`

- Comment on line 1: `python-project-template` → `<project_name>`

### 3k. Update `docs/index.html`

- `href="api/app.html"` → `href="api/<package_name>.html"`

### 3l. Update `LICENSE`

- `Copyright (c) 2026, eol` → `Copyright (c) 2026, <author_name>`

### 3m. Update `project_defaults.json`

Replace all 6 values with what the user provided. This is always the last file changed.

### 3n. Set git remote

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<github_username>/<project_name>.git
```

## Step 4 — Smoke Test

```bash
uv sync --all-extras && uv run task test-fast
```

Both must succeed. If `uv run task test-fast` fails and the failure is caused by a variable substitution that was missed (e.g. an import still referencing `app` instead of `<package_name>`), apply the same substitution pattern to fix it. If the failure has any other cause, report the error and stop — do not attempt to fix it.

## Step 5 — Done

Tell the user which files were changed (list them). Then show next steps:

```bash
# Commit the setup
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: initialize project from python-project-template"
git push -u origin main

# Optional: rename the project folder (run from the parent directory)
cd .. && mv python-project-template <project_name>
```

Then tell the user to start the workflow:

```
@product-owner
```

The PO picks the first feature from backlog and moves it to in-progress.
