## Identity

- **Project name:** temple8
- **Tagline:** From zero to hero — production-ready Python, without the ceremony.
- **Mission:** Eliminate boilerplate so engineers ship features, not setup.
- **Vision:** The standard starting point for any serious Python project — the bedrock every Python engineer reaches for first.
- **Tone of voice:** Direct, precise, minimal. The Greeks did not decorate the Parthenon with apologies. Neither do we.

## Visual

The palette is drawn from classical marble, parchment, and gold — materials that have carried ideas for millennia. Every colour choice serves legibility first; decoration is secondary.

- **Background/parchment:** `#faf7f2` → `#ede8e0`  — warm off-white, the surface on which ideas are set down
- **Primary text:** `#5c3d1e` → `#3b2410`           — deep warm brown, the ink that endures
- **Accent/gold:** `#c9a84c` → `#e8c96a`            — antique gold, used for borders and structural lines only — never body text
- **Secondary/blue:** `#7baabf` → `#4a7a96`         — Aegean steel blue, for labels and secondary hierarchy
- **Stone/marble:** `#f0ece4` → `#c8c0b8`           — the load-bearing colour; columns, shapes, structural chrome
- **Logo:** `docs/assets/logo.svg`
- **Banner:** `docs/assets/banner.svg`

> Deep brown `#3b2410` on parchment `#faf7f2` achieves >10:1 contrast (WCAG AAA). Gold is decorative; it never carries meaning that must be read.

### Logo

Greek temple façade — pediment, four columns, three-step stylobate. A gold lemniscate (∞) sits in the centre of the pediment; it reads as ∞ or 8 depending on size. Transparent background. Stone-light `#f0ece4` / `#c8c0b8` fill, `#5c3d1e` brown outlines, gold `#c9a84c` ∞ glyph.

### Banner

Warm parchment `#faf7f2` background. Left zone: temple mark (same geometry as logo, scaled). Right zone: `TEMPLE·VIII` typeset with engraved two-layer effect — front layer `#f0ece4` (stone-light), shadow layer `#3b2410` (deep brown) offset +3px right / +4px down. Middle dot `·` in gold `#c9a84c`. Gold accent rules above and below the title. Gold top and bottom border bands. Vertical gold divider separating temple from title zone. No subtitle.

## Release Naming

- **Convention:** `adjective-greek-figure`
- **Theme:** Greek antiquity — philosophers, heroes, gods, mythological figures. Every release name should read like an epithet: something a figure *earned* through their defining quality (e.g. "Resolute Athena", "Precise Pythagoras", "Luminous Hypatia").
- **Rationale:** Ancient Greece is the origin of the intellectual tradition that underpins Western civilisation — democracy, systematic philosophy, formal logic, and scientific reasoning all trace their lineage to the Greek city-states. Plato and Aristotle invented political philosophy as a genre; Aristotle formalised logic and ethics; the Pythagoreans established that abstract reasoning could describe the physical world. This template stands on the same premise: rigorous method, applied from the beginning, produces something worth building on. The Greek figure in each release name is not decoration — it is a statement about what kind of work this is.
- **Excluded words:** *(none)*

## Wording

Every word carries weight. The Greeks had a name for ornament that obscures meaning: *kenophonia* — empty noise.

- **Avoid:** `easy`, `simple`, `just`, `quick`, `scaffold` — these words undermine engineer credibility or imply the work is trivial. A temple is not a scaffold.
- **Prefer:** `minimal`, `precise`, `production-ready`, `zero-boilerplate`, `rigorous`, `from zero to hero`

## Project Summary

A Python project template with a production-ready AI-assisted delivery workflow.
Ships with quality tooling (ruff, pyright, pytest, hypothesis), Gherkin-driven
acceptance criteria, and five specialised AI agents covering scope through release.
Built on the premise that rigorous method, applied from the beginning, produces
something worth building on. Use this summary in banners, release notes, and document headers.
