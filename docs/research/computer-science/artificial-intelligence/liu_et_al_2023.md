## Key Insight

Language models exhibit U-shaped attention pattern - information at beginning and end of long context receives significantly more attention than middle content.

## Core Findings

1. **U-Shaped Performance Pattern**: Performance highest when relevant information occurs at beginning or end of input context, degrades significantly in middle positions
2. **Multi-Document QA Results**: Even explicitly long-context models struggle to access information in middle of long contexts
3. **Key-Value Retrieval Degradation**: Performance drops substantially when target information positioned in middle sections
4. **Primacy/Recency Effects**: Beginning benefits from setting attention baseline, end benefits from proximity to output position
5. **Context Length Impact**: Performance degradation becomes more pronounced as context length increases

## Mechanism

Transformer attention patterns distribute weight unevenly across sequence positions. Beginning content benefits from primacy effects (first tokens establish attention baseline), end content benefits from recency effects (proximity to output). Middle content competes with both extremes and receives proportionally less attention weight, causing information retrieval failures.

## Relevance

Critical for long-context AI applications, prompt engineering strategies, context window utilization. Essential for understanding attention limitations in large language models, designing effective retrieval-augmented generation systems, optimizing document processing workflows.
