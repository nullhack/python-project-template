## Key Insight

The architect's job is not to draw diagrams—it is to make **significant decisions** that are hard to change later. The architect is a facilitator who builds consensus around technical direction, not a dictator who issues edicts.

## Core Findings

1. **Four architect archetypes**: Architect as Decision-Maker (owns hard-to-change choices), Expert (provides technical depth), Facilitator (brings stakeholders to consensus), and Gatekeeper (enforces standards and reviews compliance).
2. **Programming architects superiority**: The best architects are also programmers who understand implementation constraints firsthand rather than ivory-tower theorists.
3. **Policy vs. detail separation**: The architect owns **policy** (business rules, interfaces, architectural constraints) while developers own **detail** (algorithms, data structures, implementation mechanics).
4. **Significant decisions focus**: Architecture is about making important decisions that affect the system's ability to meet its quality requirements, not about creating comprehensive documentation.
5. **Facilitation over dictation**: Effective architects build consensus and shared understanding rather than issuing top-down mandates.
6. **Hands-on involvement**: Architects must stay involved in implementation to understand real-world constraints and trade-offs.

## Mechanism

This separation enables independent evolution of concerns - policy can change without affecting implementation details, and vice versa. The architect focuses on decisions that are expensive to change later (technology choices, integration patterns, quality attribute strategies) while leaving implementation flexibility to developers. Facilitation works better than dictation because it creates buy-in and shared understanding, making architectural decisions more likely to be followed and adapted appropriately as circumstances change.

## Relevance

Foundational framework for defining architectural roles and responsibilities in modern software development. The system-architect role combines decision-maker and gatekeeper functions: making architectural decisions (ADRs) and enforcing them through adversarial review. Essential for understanding the balance between architectural guidance and implementation autonomy in agile development environments.
