## Key Insight

Quality attributes — not functional requirements — drive architectural decisions. Performance, availability, security, modifiability, reliability, and usability create measurable constraints that determine system structure.

## Core Findings

1. **Quality attribute primacy**: Six architecturally significant quality attributes (Performance, Availability, Security, Modifiability, Reliability, Usability) drive structural decisions more than functional requirements.
2. **Architectural tactics catalog**: Each quality attribute produces concrete architectural tactics — Performance tactics include resource arbitration, concurrency, caching; Modifiability tactics include encapsulation, substitution, binding time.
3. **Style-attribute alignment**: Architectural style selection must be justified against quality attribute priorities, not personal preference or technology trends.
4. **Utility tree methodology**: Systematic approach to prioritize quality attributes against business value, producing ranked constraints for architectural decision-making.
5. **Trade-off recognition**: Quality attributes often conflict — optimizing for Performance may harm Modifiability, requiring explicit trade-off decisions.
6. **ATAM integration**: Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method provides structured evaluation framework for discovering architectural risks early.
7. **Measurable constraints**: Quality attributes work because they create concrete, testable constraints on system structure rather than abstract goals.

## Mechanism

Quality attributes work as architectural drivers because they create measurable constraints on system structure. Performance requires specific structural patterns (caching layers, async processing, resource pooling); Modifiability requires different patterns (abstraction layers, dependency inversion, plugin architectures). These constraints are often in tension — optimizing for Performance may harm Modifiability. The utility tree method forces stakeholders to prioritize quality attributes against business value, producing a ranked list that architects use to make trade-off decisions with explicit justification.

## Relevance

Foundational methodology for architectural decision-making and system design. Essential for understanding how non-functional requirements translate into concrete structural choices. Critical for architectural evaluation, technology selection, and trade-off analysis. Widely adopted framework used by enterprise architects, system designers, and software engineering teams globally.
