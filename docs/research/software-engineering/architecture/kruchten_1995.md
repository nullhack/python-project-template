## Key Insight

Software architecture cannot be adequately captured in a single model or view. The 4+1 model provides multiple, complementary perspectives that together form a complete architectural description.

## Core Findings

1. **Five complementary views**: Logical view (object model, functional requirements), Process view (concurrency, distribution, performance), Physical view (deployment, hardware topology), Development view (static organization, modules, subsystems), and Scenarios (+1) that tie views together through use cases.
2. **Stakeholder-specific concerns**: Each view addresses different stakeholder concerns and quality attributes - developers need Development view, system integrators need Physical view, performance engineers need Process view.
3. **Scenario validation**: The scenarios (+1) validate that the architecture works as an integrated whole by showing how the views collaborate to support key use cases.
4. **Quality attribute mapping**: Each view specifically addresses non-functional requirements - Performance (Process), Availability (Physical), Modifiability (Development), Functionality (Logical).
5. **Multi-perspective necessity**: Architecture is not just structure - it must address non-functional requirements through specific design decisions in each view.
6. **IEEE 1471 influence**: Kruchten's work heavily influenced IEEE 1471-2000 standard for architectural description.

## Mechanism

The model emphasizes that architecture is not just structure—it must address non-functional requirements (performance, availability, modifiability) through specific design decisions in each view. Each view uses different notation and focuses on different architectural elements, but scenarios weave through all views to demonstrate end-to-end system behavior. This multi-perspective approach ensures no critical architectural concern is overlooked while avoiding the complexity of a single, monolithic architectural model.

## Relevance

Foundational framework for architectural documentation and communication. C4 diagrams and modern architectural documentation templates follow this multi-view principle. Context, Container, Component, and Code diagrams provide complementary perspectives that together describe complete architecture. Essential for enterprise architecture, system design documentation, and architectural review processes.
