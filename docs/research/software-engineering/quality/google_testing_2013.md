## Key Insight

Test setup may need to change if implementation changes, but the actual test assertion should not need to change if the code's user-facing behavior doesn't change.

## Core Findings

1. **Implementation Independence**: Tests should focus on testing code's public API, not internal implementation details
2. **Maintenance Benefits**: Tests independent of implementation details are easier to maintain since they don't need changes with each implementation change
3. **Documentation Value**: Behavior-focused tests act as code samples showing different ways class methods can be used
4. **Setup vs Assertion**: Test setup may change with implementation (e.g., new constructor dependencies) but assertions should remain stable
5. **Brittleness Prevention**: Tests tightly coupled to implementation details break during refactoring and become drag on design improvement

## Mechanism

Implementation-focused tests verify internal structure (method calls, object creation, internal state) creating brittleness. Behavior-focused tests verify observable outcomes that users can witness, providing stability. Former creates maintenance overhead; latter provides lasting value through internal rewrites.

## Relevance

Essential for maintainable test suites, refactoring safety, TDD practices. Applied in contract testing, behavior-driven development, test design principles. Foundational for writing tests from caller's perspective without knowledge of internal implementation mechanics.
