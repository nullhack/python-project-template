## Key Insight

The cost of fixing a software defect escalates by roughly an order of magnitude at each subsequent lifecycle phase — from 1× during requirements to 100× after deployment.

## Core Findings

1. **Phase-dependent cost escalation**: Based on TRW and IBM project data, the relative cost to fix a defect grows exponentially with phase: requirements (1×), design (~5×), implementation (~10×), unit test (~20×), acceptance test (~50×), and operations (~100–1000×).
2. **Quantified defect origin**: Roughly 60–80% of defects originate in requirements and design, yet the majority of fix effort is expended during later phases when those defects are discovered.
3. **Early investment leverage**: Investing in requirements verification and design reviews yields disproportionately high returns because each defect caught early avoids the multiplicative cost of late-phase remediation.
4. **COCOMO foundation**: The data underpins the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO), which quantifies how project attributes (complexity, team capability, schedule pressure) affect effort and defect rates.
5. **Software cost dominance**: Boehm demonstrated that software costs (not hardware) would dominate system budgets, reversing the prevailing assumption of his era.

## Mechanism

The exponential cost curve arises because late-phase defect fixes require re-traversing all upstream work: re-specifying, re-designing, re-implementing, and re-verifying. A requirements error found in operations forces revisiting every downstream artifact, whereas catching it during requirements review costs only the specification revision. The mechanism is compounding rework — each phase that passes with an undetected defect adds a layer of dependent decisions and artifacts that must also be corrected.

## Relevance

Directly justifies investment in upfront specification (event storming, domain modeling, ubiquitous language) and early validation (BDD scenarios, TDD) in our workflow. The 10× per phase curve means that a defect caught in review costs 1× what it would cost in production — validating the economic case for design-phase quality gates and the "shift left" principle embedded in our flow.
