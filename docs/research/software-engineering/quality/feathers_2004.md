## Key Insight

Legacy code is code without tests - the safest way to modify it is to first write characterization tests that capture current behavior, then refactor under the safety net of those tests.

## Core Findings

1. **Legacy code definition**: Code without automated tests, making it dangerous to modify and prone to introducing bugs during changes.
2. **Characterization tests methodology**: Tests that document what code currently does (not what it should do) - essential when modifying untested code to create regression safety net.
3. **Seam-based approach**: Seams (parameter seams, link seams, preprocessing seams, object seams) are points where behavior can be varied without editing code - primary mechanism for getting legacy code under test.
4. **Test-first modification**: Process is identify seam, get code under test by writing characterization test at that seam, then refactor safely.
5. **"Edit and pray" elimination**: Replaces dangerous "modify and hope nothing breaks" approach with disciplined "test, then modify, then verify" cycle.

## Mechanism

Characterization tests differ from specification tests: they document what code currently does, not what it should do. This creates regression protection before any changes are made. Seams allow injecting test doubles at specific points without modifying production code. Process: identify seam, get code under test, write characterization test, then refactor. Avoids dangerous untested modifications.

## Relevance

Essential methodology for working with legacy codebases safely. Critical for organizations maintaining large existing systems without comprehensive test coverage. Foundational approach for incremental improvement of legacy systems and technical debt reduction.
