## Key Insight

Design patterns provide reusable solutions to recurring design problems by naming proven structural approaches that teams can communicate at higher abstraction level.

## Core Findings

1. **Pattern catalog**: 23 design patterns divided into three categories by intent: Creational (abstracting object creation), Structural (composing classes/objects into larger structures), Behavioral (allocating responsibility between objects).
2. **Communication abstraction**: Patterns name recurring design structures enabling teams to communicate at higher level - saying "Strategy pattern" conveys entire structural solution.
3. **Problem-solution mapping**: Each pattern captures proven solution to specific class of design problem - Strategy eliminates type-switching, Observer decouples event sources from handlers, State replaces conditional state machines.
4. **Foundational principles**: "Program to interface, not implementation" and "Favor object composition over class inheritance" guide pattern application.
5. **Massive influence**: Over 500,000 copies sold in 14 languages, ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Achievement Award 2005, foundational for object-oriented design.

## Mechanism

Patterns work by naming recurring design structures so teams can communicate at higher level of abstraction. Each pattern captures proven solution to specific class of design problem. Patterns should be applied only when code smell triggers them, never speculatively. The smell identifies the gap; the pattern provides structural solution.

## Relevance

Foundational reference for object-oriented design and software architecture. Essential vocabulary for software development teams and architectural decision-making. Widely adopted across programming languages and frameworks for systematic design improvement.
