## Key Insight

Tests should specify observable behavior, not verify implementation - coupling to internal details creates brittle tests that break during refactoring even when behavior is preserved.

## Core Findings

1. **Test coupling spectrum**: Four levels from most resilient to most brittle: end-to-end tests (highest), unit contract tests, property-based tests, and white-box tests (lowest, avoid).
2. **Implementation coupling danger**: Tests coupled to implementation details break when code is refactored even when behavior is preserved, producing false negatives that erode trust in test suite.
3. **Semantic alignment rule**: Tests must operate at same abstraction level as acceptance criterion they verify - if criterion says "user presses W," test sends W through actual input mechanism, not internal method call.
4. **Observable behavior focus**: Decoupled tests use public interfaces and assert on observable outcomes, remaining green through refactoring because they verify what system does, not how it does it.
5. **Test pattern catalog**: Comprehensive patterns for test organization, fixture management, result verification, and test code maintainability in xUnit frameworks.

## Mechanism

Test coupling arises when test depends on how system works internally rather than what it does externally. Coupled tests use private methods, internal state, or implementation-specific assertions. When implementation changes — even if behavior is identical — coupled tests fail, creating noise that trains developers to ignore test failures. Decoupled tests use public interfaces and assert on observable outcomes, remaining green through refactoring.

## Relevance

Essential reference for writing maintainable test code in xUnit frameworks (JUnit, NUnit, etc.). Foundational for test-driven development practices and ensuring tests support rather than hinder refactoring. Widely used for improving test suite quality and reducing test maintenance burden.
