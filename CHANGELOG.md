# Changelog

All notable changes to this template will be documented in this file.

## [v8.1.0+20260502] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **Git branch discipline**: Every state in all 12 flow YAML files now declares `git: main` or `git: feature` in its attrs. Agents must work on the declared branch and never switch mid-state. Golden Rule #7 added to AGENTS.md.
- **Committed-to-main guards**: Project-phase exit transitions (discovery, architecture, planning, branding, setup) now require `committed_to_main_locally: ==verified` evidence before advancing. Ensures artifacts are persisted before moving to the next phase.
- **flowr 0.4.0 adoption**: Upgraded dependency from `>=0.3` to `>=0.4`. Added `[tool.flowr]` config section to pyproject.toml (flows_dir, sessions_dir, default_flow, default_session).
- **Session management**: `.flowr/sessions/` directory for persisting workflow progress. AGENTS.md updated with session init, `--session` flag usage, and session-based workflow pattern.
- **Flow params**: Feature-scoped flows (planning, development, delivery, tdd-cycle, review-gate, feature-development) now declare `params: [feature_name]` for session parameter tracking.
- **Flowr commands**: AGENTS.md and knowledge files updated with session commands (`init`, `show`, `set-state`, `list`), `--session` flag on check/next/transition, `config` command, short flow name resolution, and `--evidence-json` flag.
- **flowr-spec.md knowledge**: Session model (flow, state, name, stack, params), configuration resolution, MUST/SHOULD severity levels on validation rules, atomic session writes principle.
- **flowr-operations.md knowledge**: Session commands, session-based workflow pattern, configuration section, evidence syntax with condition operators.
- **Research note**: `docs/research/software-engineering/process/nullhack_flowr_0.4.0.md` documenting flowr 0.4.0 analysis.

### Changed

- **Flow version bumps**: main-flow 7→8, discovery-flow 3→4, architecture-flow 4→5, planning-flow 4→5, feature-development-flow 6→7, development-flow 4→5, delivery-flow 4→5, tdd-cycle-flow 2→3, review-gate-flow 2→3, post-mortem-flow 2→3, branding-flow 2→3, setup-project-flow 2→3.

## [v8.0.0+20260501] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Flow attrs simplification**: Replaced `input_artifacts`/`edited_artifacts`/`output_artifacts` with `in`/`out` across all 12 flow YAML files and 28 SKILL.md files. `in` is read-only; `out` may create or edit with optional section hints.
- **Artifact naming clarity**: Renamed runtime artifacts for descriptiveness (`py_stubs`→`typed_source_stubs`, `test_stubs`→`test_skeletons`, `test_bodies`→`test_implementations`, `function_bodies`→`source_implementations`, `refactored_code`→`refactored_source`, `commits`→`feature_commits`, `local_main_commits`→`merged_commits`, `root_cause`→`root_cause_analysis`).
- **Feature test stub template**: `.templates/tests/features/<rule_slug>_test.py.template` with `@pytest.mark.skip`, Gherkin docstrings, `raise NotImplementedError`.
- **Two-phase stub creation**: `create-py-stubs` skill (SA creates typed stubs and test stubs per feature in planning flow); `structure-project` now creates package skeleton only.
- **`verify-traceability` skill**: Verifies 1-1 correspondence between `@id` tags in feature files and test functions in `tests/features/`. Catches missing tests (feature not done) and orphan tests (should be in `tests/unit/`).
- **Semantic depth traceability**: `@id` tests must exercise the entry point the acceptance criterion describes (CLI handler, API endpoint), not just domain logic in isolation. Checks added to `verify-traceability`, `review-structure`, and `accept-feature` skills.
- **Spec compliance check**: `define-done` skill now verifies that interface elements documented in the technical design (CLI flags, config keys, API parameters) exist in the implementation.
- **Test location convention**: `tests/features/` is exclusively for `@id`-linked BDD scenario tests. Coverage-boosting tests belong in `tests/unit/`. Added to `test-design.md`, `tdd.md`, and `gherkin.md` knowledge files.
- **Feature selection dependency rule**: Only Dependency=0 features are eligible for selection, regardless of WSJF score. Clarified in `wsjf.md` and `select-feature/SKILL.md`.
- **Generic flowr exit steps in skills**: All 41 SKILL.md files now end with "Advance the flow with necessary evidence, choosing the appropriate next state based on the work completed" instead of hardcoding `flowr advance <transition>`. Agents learn how from `[[workflow/flowr-operations]]` knowledge and AGENTS.md Session Protocol.
- **`[[workflow/flowr-operations]]` knowledge file**: Full command reference for `flowr check`, `next`, `transition`, `states`, `validate`, `mermaid` with evidence flags and workflow pattern.
- **Real flowr commands in AGENTS.md**: Replaced fictional `flowr status`/`flowr advance` with actual CLI commands (`python -m flowr check`, `next`, `transition`). Owner dispatch promoted to top-level step 2 in Session Protocol.
- **Template-safe references**: Removed project name from AGENTS.md title and versioning.md example.
- **`[[software-craft/test-design]]` loaded by TDD skills**: Added to `write-test` and `implement-minimum` skill load lists so agents have test location and coupling knowledge during RED and GREEN phases.
- **Full knowledge loading for review skills**: `review-design` loads 9 full docs, `review-structure` loads 3 full docs, `review-conventions` loads 2 full docs. Evaluation/review/detection needs full documents, not fragments.
- **`task regenerate-flowviz`**: Regenerates `.flowr/viz/data.js` from flow YAML definitions.
- **`task validate-flows`**: Validates all flow definitions.

### Changed

- **Flow artifact fixes**: Removed `stories.md` intermediate from planning flow (feature-breakdown writes Rules, bdd-features writes Examples directly into `.feature`). Added `interview-notes/*.md` to stakeholder-interview.in. Replaced `review_gate_evidence` with three individual review evidences.
- **Architecture-assessment conditions**: Added `architecture_complete` condition. Fixed `no_architecture_exists` to check `technical_design_md` and `context_map_md` (not `system.md`).
- **MoSCoW prevention**: MoSCoW classification is internal triage only, must NOT appear as Gherkin tags. Updated `moscow.md`, `write-bdd-features` SKILL.md, `feature.feature.template`.
- **Minimum stub principle**: Protocol signatures + `raise NotImplementedError`, no docstrings, no type hints beyond contract. Docstrings/type hints/lint added when reviewers require them.
- **Reviewer role**: Reviewer MUST NOT modify files — only APPROVED/REJECTED reports. 'Minor' is not a pass — acknowledged smells are still findings.
- **Terminology**: 'cosmetic' → 'conventions', 'Completion Phase' → 'Conventions Phase'.
- **On-demand reading**: `in` artifacts are read on demand, not eagerly. Applies to all files — spec documents, production code, and test code.
- **Spec doc protection**: Specification documents are read-only during TDD. SE may ONLY modify production code and test code. Gaps flagged in output notes.
- **Session protocol**: AGENTS.md Session Protocol uses real flowr CLI commands (`check` for state entry, `next` for available paths, `transition` for advancing). Owner dispatch is top-level step 2. Skills use generic exit instructions referencing `[[workflow/flowr-operations]]`.
- **Artifact existence guarantee**: File artifacts in `in`/`out` are created from templates lazily. Missing non-Python templates raise error. Environment artifacts produced by tooling.
- **WSJF selection rules**: Clarified — only Dependency=0 features eligible. Ties broken by Value. If all blocked, resolve dependency first then re-score.
- **Flowviz moved to `.flowr/viz/`**: Interactive D3 visualization data now lives under `.flowr/viz/` instead of `flowviz/`.
- **Removed `scripts/flowr-utils.sh` and `scripts/generate-svg.sh`**: Agents use `python -m flowr` directly. SVG generation was broken for all but one flow.
- **Research files**: All 71+ research files converted to v8 template format with Source Type, Method, Verification Status, Confidence, Key Insight, Core Findings, Mechanism, Relevance, Related Research. Citation reference fixes (Tetlock 1983→1985, Brown 2006→2018, king_1991_mutation→demillo_lipton_sayward_1978).

### Removed

- **`stories.md` intermediate**: Feature-breakdown writes Rules directly into `.feature`, bdd-features writes Examples directly. No separate stories file.
- **`scripts/flowr-utils.sh`**: Agents use `python -m flowr` commands directly per AGENTS.md.
- **`scripts/generate-svg.sh`**: Only worked for tdd-cycle-flow; mermaid-cli compatibility issues with all other flows.
- **`review_gate_evidence`**: Replaced by three individual evidences (design_review_evidence, structure_review_evidence, conventions_review_evidence).

## [v8.0.0+20260430] - Methodical Theseus - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Flow-based delivery system**: Hierarchical state machines (`.flowr/flows/`) replace monolithic agents/skills — main-flow → discovery → architecture → feature-development, with planning/development/delivery/post-mortem subflows
- **Identity-only agents**: 5 agents (product-owner, domain-expert, system-architect, reviewer, software-engineer) matching flow owners — no routing, artifacts, or skill lists in agent files
- **Procedure-only skills**: 26 skills mapped to flow states — no identity or routing logic
- **Progressive knowledge**: Split/rewrote 15+ knowledge files with `#key-takeaways`/`#concepts` fragments for token-efficient loading
- **Flowviz**: Interactive D3+dagre visualization for all 10 flows (`flowviz/`)
- **Document templates**: 11 templates in `.templates/` with instance path mapping in `AGENTS.md`
- **Research library**: 41 structured research notes under `docs/research/` with citation metadata
- **Versioning scheme**: Semver (`major.minor.patch`) in pyproject.toml; git tags append `+YYYYMMDD` build metadata; PyPI uses semver core only — see `[[software-craft/versioning]]`
- **`software-engineer` agent**: Identity-only agent for the SE flow owner role

### Changed

- **Delivery flow v3**: `publish-decision` replaces `batch-decision`; both `accumulate` and `approved` transitions exit as `next-feature`; removed self-loop from main-flow
- **AGENTS.md**: Added Template Instances table mapping templates to output paths; fixed `Temple9` → `Temple8`; progressive knowledge loading with token savings table
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Version `7.2.20260423` → `8.0.0` (correct semver); fixed `validate-flows` task; removed deleted scripts; deduplicated dev deps; removed invalid pytest option
- **`.gitignore`**: Fixed literal `\n` in directory entries; added `flowviz/data.js`
- **`template-config.yaml`**: Removed non-existent Docker file references; fixed test path; fixed version reset comment (was `0.1.YYYYMMDD`, now `0.1.0`)
- **`scripts/generate-flowviz-data.py`**: Fixed 9 lint errors (C901, D103, FURB110, FURB192, I001)
- **`select-feature/SKILL.md`**: Removed stale `docs/features/in-progress/` reference
- **`decide-batch-action/SKILL.md`**: Removed flow transition routing (skills = procedure only)
- **`.github/workflows/tag-release.yml`**: Git tags now use `v{version}+{YYYYMMDD}` format (semver + build metadata)
- **`.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml`**: Updated tag example to new format

### Removed

- **Monolithic agents/skills**: `architect`, `define-scope`, `implement`, `verify`, `update-docs`, `run-session`, `flow`, `git-release`, `create-agent`, `create-knowledge`, `create-skill`, `design-assets`, `design-colors`, `check-quality`, `apply-patterns`, `version-control` — all replaced by flow-driven architecture
- **`FLOW.md` and `WORK.md`**: Replaced by `.flowr/flows/` YAML state machines and `.flowr/sessions/` runtime state
- **Stale docs**: `docs/research/` (flat files), `docs/features/completed/`, `docs/features/in-progress/`, `docs/adr/` old ADRs, `docs/product-definition.md`, `docs/glossary.md`, `docs/system.md`, `docs/scope_journal.md`, `docs/assets/workflow.svg`
- **11 obsolete scripts**: `assign_ids.py`, `check_adrs.py`, `check_commit_messages.py`, `check_feature_file.py`, `check_knowledge.py`, `check_oc.py`, `check_stubs.py`, `check_version.py`, `check_work_md.py`, `detect_state.py`, `score_features.py`, `update_index_html.py`
- **`designer.md` and `setup-project.md`** agents: `designer` absorbed into branding skill; `setup-project` to be reintroduced as flow-driven standalone

## Pre-v8 History

Releases v1.0.0 through v7.2 used a hybrid calver scheme where the date occupied the semver patch field (e.g. `v7.2.20260423`). Starting with v8.0.0, the versioning scheme uses proper semver `major.minor.patch` in `pyproject.toml` with `+YYYYMMDD` build metadata in git tags only.
