## Key Insight

Icons must be designed at the smallest target size first and then scaled up, adding detail only at larger sizes.

## Core Findings

1. **Progressive simplification methodology**: Create separate pixel-perfect versions at each target size tier (16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 128px, 256px, 512px) rather than scaling a single vector.
2. **Size-tier optimization**: At each tier, remove details that cannot be rendered at that resolution and exaggerate key features for clarity.
3. **Visual acuity limitations**: At 16×16 pixels, fine lines (under 2px), subtle gradients, and interior details vanish or create visual noise.
4. **Industry standard practice**: Progressive simplification is the standard methodology used by professional icon designers including major software companies.
5. **Firefox and Skype precedent**: Hicks' work on major brand icons demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach at scale.
6. **Downscaling failure**: Simply downscaling a 512px icon to 16px produces a muddy, unrecognizable mark that fails usability tests.

## Mechanism

Hicks' tier system works because human visual acuity is finite. At 16×16 pixels, fine lines (under 2px), subtle gradients, and interior details vanish or create visual noise. At 512×512, those same details add richness. Progressive simplification acknowledges this by treating each size tier as a distinct design problem: the 16px version is a hand-optimized silhouette, the 32px version may add one key interior detail, the 128px version adds secondary features, and the 512px version is the full design.

## Relevance

Essential methodology for any icon system, mobile app design, or interface requiring icons at multiple resolutions. Critical for responsive design systems, desktop applications, and brand identity systems that must work across various scales and contexts. Directly applicable to favicon design, app icon creation, and UI iconography.
