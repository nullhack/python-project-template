## Key Insight

A meaningful test fails when a mutation (small deliberate code change) is introduced - if test survives every mutation without failing, it tests nothing useful.

## Core Findings

1. **Competent Programmer Hypothesis**: Competent programmers write programs close to being correct behaviorally
2. **Coupling Effect**: Simple faults cascade to form other emergent faults, so detecting simple mutations catches complex bugs
3. **RIP Model**: Tests must Reach mutated statement, Infect program state, and Propagate incorrect state to output
4. **Equivalent Mutants Problem**: Some mutants produce behaviorally equivalent programs, creating analysis challenges  
5. **Quality Measurement**: Mutation score (mutants killed / total mutants) provides objective test quality metric

## Mechanism

Mutation testing systematically introduces small bugs into code using mutation operators (arithmetic/relational/logical changes) and checks whether tests detect them. Tests failing to catch artificial bugs indicate weak test quality or missing edge cases. Strong mutation requires full RIP model satisfaction; weak mutation only requires reach/infect.

## Relevance

Essential for test quality assessment, TDD validation, regression testing. Applied in modern tools (PITest, Stryker, mutmut, cosmic-ray). Fundamental for measuring test effectiveness beyond code coverage, ensuring tests constrain actual behavior rather than implementation details.
