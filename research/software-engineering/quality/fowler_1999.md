## Key Insight

Refactoring is disciplined technique for restructuring existing code without changing external behavior, done in small steps each verified by tests.

## Core Findings

1. **Catalog methodology**: 66 named transformations (Extract Method, Move Field, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, etc.) each with known pre-condition, mechanic, and effect on code structure.
2. **Code smell diagnostics**: Diagnostic indicators (Long Method, Feature Envy, Switch Statements, etc.) signal when refactoring is needed and point to specific techniques.
3. **Test-driven safety**: Small, test-verified steps ensure restructuring doesn't introduce bugs while improving design quality.
4. **Behavior preservation**: External functionality remains unchanged while internal structure improves through systematic transformations.
5. **Design emergence**: Better design emerges through incremental improvements rather than upfront architectural decisions.

## Mechanism

Each refactoring has known pre-condition (when safe to apply), step-by-step mechanic (the transformation), and guaranteed post-condition (what improves). By applying refactorings in small, test-verified steps, developer can restructure code safely without introducing bugs. Code smells serve as diagnostic indicators pointing to specific refactoring technique most likely to improve structure. The smell identifies problem; refactoring provides solution.

## Relevance

Foundational methodology for systematic code improvement and design evolution. Essential practice for maintaining code quality, reducing technical debt, and enabling sustainable software development. Widely adopted as core agile development practice.
