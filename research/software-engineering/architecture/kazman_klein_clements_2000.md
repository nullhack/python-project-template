## Key Insight

Architecture should be evaluated early through structured scenario analysis. ATAM discovers **trade-offs** and **sensitivity points** before implementation begins, when change cost is minimal.

## Core Findings

1. **Risk-mitigation roadmap**: ATAM produces a structured assessment of architectural risks rather than a simple pass/fail verdict.
2. **Nine-step process**: Systematic methodology covering stakeholder presentation, business driver analysis, architecture presentation, approach identification, quality attribute tree generation, analysis, scenario brainstorming, re-analysis, and results presentation.
3. **Sensitivity points identification**: Reveals architectural decisions that most significantly affect quality attributes.
4. **Trade-off points analysis**: Identifies decisions affecting multiple quality attributes in opposing ways, highlighting necessary compromises.
5. **Quality attribute focus**: Structures evaluation around specific quality concerns (performance, security, maintainability, etc.) rather than general architectural goodness.
6. **Stakeholder-driven scenarios**: Uses real stakeholder scenarios to test architectural decisions against actual usage patterns and concerns.

## Mechanism

The method reveals how architectural decisions affect quality attributes and identifies decisions that most impact system success. ATAM works by systematically walking through architectural approaches against stakeholder-prioritized quality attribute scenarios. Sensitivity points emerge when small changes in architectural decisions cause large changes in quality attribute response. Trade-off points appear when architectural decisions improve one quality attribute while degrading another, forcing explicit design trade-offs.

## Relevance

Foundational methodology for architectural assessment and review processes. ATAM-style analysis is applied in adversarial review during verification: testing implemented architecture against quality-attribute scenarios identified during design. Essential for system architects who need to evaluate architectural decisions before implementation when change costs are minimal.
