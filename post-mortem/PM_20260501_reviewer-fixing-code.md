# PM_20260501_reviewer-fixing-code: Reviewer fixing code instead of rejecting and routing back to TDD

## Failed At

review-gate (Design/Structure/Conventions review) — stakeholder: "Why are reviewers not done properly? Why is R fixing code instead of moving the state back to TDD with a description of what needs to be changed?"

## Root Cause

The reviewer role was conflated with the implementer role. Three process violations occurred simultaneously:

1. Reviewer approved code smells as "minor" or "acceptable trade-off" instead of listing them as findings.
2. Orchestrator fixed spec docs and code directly instead of routing REJECTED back to TDD.
3. Lint/type errors were auto-fixed during review instead of reported as findings for the SE to fix.

## Missed Gate

The review-gate state. Each review tier should produce APPROVED or REJECTED without modifying any files. On REJECTED, the flow routes back to the TDD cycle — the SE implements fixes, not the reviewer.

## Fix

1. Added three rules to `code-review.md` Key Takeaways:
   - "The reviewer MUST NOT modify any files — produce APPROVED or REJECTED report only. On REJECTED, the flow routes back to the TDD cycle; the SE implements fixes, not the reviewer."
   - "'Minor' is not a pass — code smells that are acknowledged must still be listed as findings for the SE to evaluate."
   - "Lint and type errors are findings to report, not to fix during review. The SE fixes them in the next TDD cycle."
2. Updated `review-design/SKILL.md` step 6: smell findings are listed, not dismissed as "minor" — references `code-review#key-takeaways`.
3. Updated `review-conventions/SKILL.md`: added `code-review#key-takeaways` to load list and added explicit rule that reviewer MUST NOT modify files — lint errors are findings, not auto-fix opportunities.
4. Strengthened `code-review.md` Concepts section with same rules.

## Restart Check

SA verifies that:
- [ ] All three review sub-gates produce APPROVED/REJECTED verdicts without modifying any files
- [ ] On REJECTED, the flow transitions back to TDD with a findings document
- [ ] No code or spec doc changes are made during the review-gate state
- [ ] Code smells are explicitly listed in findings rather than dismissed as "minor"
